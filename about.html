        Angus & Julia Stone are a sibling singing/ songwriting duo whose music spans intimate folk and dreamy indie pop. Growing up on the northern beaches of Sydney, the Stone siblings were schooled in pop music at an early age by their father, who played in a local cover band. In 2005, Julia Stone began teaching trumpet lessons while her brother Angus worked as a laborer. She convinced him to test his musical talents by performing locally, and he responded by bringing her on-stage with him as a backing musician. The duo released an EP of early material, Chocolates & Cigarettes, before moving to London in 2006, where the siblings met Fran Healy of the band Travis. Impressed with the Stones' material, as well as their growing buzz in both Australia and England, Healy invited them to his house to use his piano. Angus & Julia Stone's debut album, A Book Like This, was then released in 2007 by Flock Music and Nettwerk and charted in the Top Ten in the bandmates' native Australia. An international release followed in March 2008. Two years later the group returned with Down the Way, which introduced a bigger, bolder sound. A breakthrough success for the duo, the album debuted at number one in Australia, and earned them five ARIA music awards including Album of the Year.
        <br /><br />On the heels of this success, the siblings abandoned work on a follow-up, opting instead to pursue solo work. In 2014, the siblings finally reunited for their third studio album, the Rick Rubin-produced, eponymously titled, Angus & Julia Stone. It marked their second consecutive appearance on the Billboard Americana/Folk Albums chart and again hit number one in Australia. Angus then released an LP born out of jamming with friends under the moniker Dope Lemon (2016's Honey Bones), and Angus & Julia Stone teamed up again for their fourth studio LP, 2017's Snow.
